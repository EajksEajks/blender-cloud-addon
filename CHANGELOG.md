# Blender Cloud changelog


## Version 1.9.5 (in development)

- Requires Blender-Asset-Tracer 0.7 or newer.
- Fix crashing Blender when running in background mode (e.g. without GUI).
- Flamenco: Include extra job parameters to allow for encoding a video at the end of a render
  job that produced an image sequence.
- Flamenco: Compress all blend files, and not just the one we save from Blender.
- Flamenco: Store more info in the `jobinfo.json` file. This is mostly useful for debugging issues
  on the render farm, as now things like the exclusion filter and Manager settings are logged too.
- Flamenco: Allow BAT-packing of only those assets that are referred to by relative path (e.g.
  a path starting with `//`). Assets with an absolute path are ignored, and assumed to be reachable
  at the same path by the Workers.


## Version 1.9.4 (2018-11-01)

- Fixed Python 3.6 and Blender 2.79b incompatibilities accidentally introduced in 1.9.3.


## Version 1.9.3 (2018-10-30)

- Fix drawing of Attract strips in the VSE on Blender 2.8.


## Version 1.9.2 (2018-09-17)

- No changes, just a different filename to force a refresh on our
  hosting platform.


## Version 1.9.1 (2018-09-17)

- Fix issue with Python 3.7, which is used by current daily builds of Blender.


## Version 1.9 (2018-09-05)

- Last version to support Blender versions before 2.80!
- Replace BAM with BATðŸ¦‡.
- Don't crash the texture browser when an invalid texture is seen.
- Support colour strips as Attract shots.
- Flamenco: allow jobs to be created in 'paused' state.
- Flamenco: only show Flamenco Managers that are linked to the currently selected project.


## Version 1.8 (2018-01-03)

- Distinguish between 'please subscribe' (to get a new subscription) and 'please renew' (to renew an
  existing subscription).
- When re-opening the Texture Browser it now opens in the same folder as where it was when closed.
- In the texture browser, draw the components of the texture (i.e. which map types are available),
  such as 'bump, normal, specular'.
- Use Interface Scale setting from user preferences to draw the Texture Browser text.
- Store project-specific settings in the preferences, such as filesystem paths, for each project,
  and restore those settings when the project is selected again. Does not touch settings that
  haven't been set for the newly selected project. These settings are only saved when a setting
  is updated, so to save your current settings need to update a single setting; this saves all
  settings for the project.
- Added button in the User Preferences to open a Cloud project in your webbrowser.


## Version 1.7.5 (2017-10-06)

- Sorting the project list alphabetically.
- Renamed 'Job File Path' to 'Job Storage Path' so it's more explicit.

## Version 1.7.4 (2017-09-05)

- Fix [T52621](https://developer.blender.org/T52621): Fixed class name collision upon add-on
  registration. This is checked since Blender 2.79.
- Fix [T48852](https://developer.blender.org/T48852): Screenshot no longer shows "Communicating with
  Blender Cloud".


## Version 1.7.3 (2017-08-08)

- Refuse to render on Flamenco before blend file is saved at least once.
- Fixed some Windows-specific issues.

## Version 1.6.4 (2017-04-21)

  Requires a Blender that is bundled with BAM 1.1.7 or newer.
